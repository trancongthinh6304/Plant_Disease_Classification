# Plant Disease Classification
A basic Streamlit application that classifies diseases on plants.

Models are trained using mainly Sklearn and Keras.

This project is created mainly for studying and exploring.

## Introduction
This is a simple Streamlit web application that helps users predict diseases based on their photos on plants.
Currently, we are training on 4 diseases on tomatoes leaves, and 3 diseases on grapes leaves.

### Task definition and Data
#### Task
The task is to classify the disease on leaves using simple classification method: Transered Learning.
